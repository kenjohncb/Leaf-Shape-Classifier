# Leaf-Shape-Classifier

Project Brief
Potentializing the Avalahalli replantation program by revitalizing the existing eco-system which is a speculative approach challenging the current state of the forest. 

Idea:
Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning (IMAGE CLASSIFICATION) - Drones
•	They keep count of the flora and fauna to form a database of information to track changes in the forest over time. 
•	They drones will also check as to which species of plant survive in that area.

Creating a Leaf Shape Classifier to start with

The Final Output is a p5js web editor links and not files so I am typing it here
Classifier by drawing: https://editor.p5js.org/bhasmekenneth/sketches/HkW4iA57b
Classifier using webcam (there are some errors but please do test and see if it is working): https://editor.p5js.org/bhasmekenneth/sketches/EO2_nWsde
