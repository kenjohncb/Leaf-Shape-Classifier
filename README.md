# Leaf-Shape-Classifier

Project Brief
Potentializing the Avalahalli replantation program by revitalizing the existing eco-system which is a speculative approach challenging the current state of the forest. 

Idea:
Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning (IMAGE CLASSIFICATION) - Drones
•	They keep count of the flora and fauna to form a database of information to track changes in the forest over time. 
•	They drones will also check as to which species of plant survive in that area.

Creating a Leaf Shape Classifier to start with
